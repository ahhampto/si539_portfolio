		<h3 class="uxp-title">Anxiety Management Tool</h3>
			<h4 class="projectitle">Summary:</h4>
			<p class="projectlist">I was presented with an opportunity to independently conduct a UX research and design project during fall semester 2019.  I have a passion for improving access to mental health resources, and I specifically wanted to work on improving mental health in young people.<br><br>
			To find a way to address this issue, I conducted extensive user research over the course of the semester. I ultimately designed a mobile/smartwatch integrated application with the following features:</p>
			<br>
				<ul>
				<li class="uxp-list"><span class="list-mid">Smartphone/smartwatch integration</span> - The smartwatch collects the user's heart rate data and seamlessly transfers it to the mobile application for processing.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list"><span class="list-mid">Customizable preventative/reactive treatment</span> - Upon identifying any anxiety stressors, the user could choose the preventative or reactive method that they think would benefit them most.  For example, this would include methods like strategic vibrations released by the smartwatch, positive messages displayed on the smartwatch, and relaxation instructions displayed on the smartwatch.</li>
				</ul>

		<h3 class="uxp-title">Clinic-Patient Communication Interface Research</h3>
		<h4 class="projectitle">Summary:</h4>
		<p class="projectlist">During fall semester 2019, I was given the opportunity to consult on the state of Company W's clinic communication system and social media presence; Company W has been anonymized for privacy reasons.  Company W is a non-profit organization whose mission is to provide quality healthcare services to patients of all backgrounds, with a focus on serving low-income and low-literacy individuals.<br><br>
		I worked on a team of 4 graduate students across multiple disciplines to conduct user research with Company W. The major issues that we discovered during the initial requirements gathering phase were:</p>
		<br>
			<ul>
				<li class="uxp-list">The majority of Company W's patients are immigrants who do not speak English.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">The two most spoken languages in their immigrant patient population are Arabic and Bengali.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">Company W has been experiencing very low community engagement with their social media pages, particularly Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.</li>
			</ul>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="projectlist">After conducting our qualitative research and analysis, we organized our final recommendations into 2 categories:</p>
		<br>
			<ol>
					<li class="uxp-list">Language barrier</li>
				<!--<br>-->
					<li class="uxp-list">Social media engagement</li>
			</ol>
		<br>
		<br>
		<p class="projectlist">We provided the following recommendations to Company W to address their language barrier issues:</p>
		<br>
			<ul>
				<li class="uxp-list">Collaborate with professional medical interpreters from local universities.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">Work with local medical students who are bilingual in Arabic and Bengali.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">Recruit patients who have a prior medical background to help with in-clinic translations.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">Translate education materials into Bengali and Arabic.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">Utilize visual aids to facilitate patient understanding of medical instructions and health education materials.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">Keep the phone number of English-speaking family members on file.</li>
			</ul>
		<br>
		<p class="projectlist">We provided the following recommendations to Company W to address their social media engagement issues:</p>
		<br>
			<ul>
				<li class="uxp-list">Translate all social media posts to Arabic and Bengali.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">Implement use of video content on social media platforms.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">Promote all social media links on Company W's website and social media platforms.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">Collaborate with related Facebook groups and pages to increase exposure.</li>
			</ul>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4 class="projectitle">Key methodologies:</h4>
		<p class="projectlist">Affinity wall, contextual inquiry, stakeholder interviews</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4 class="projectitle">Results:</h4>
		<p class="projectlist">Presented findings to client's executive director and clinic directors.</p>

		<h3 class="uxp-title">Government Info Tool Usability Research</h3>
		<h4 class="projectitle">Summary:</h4>
		<p class="projectlist">During winter semester 2020, I was selected to join a user testing project with the City of Ann Arbor. <br><br>
		I worked in a team of 4 graduate students in UX research to design and conduct a usability test for the City's website, with a focus on their boat livery information and rental pages. Due to the short-term nature of the testing period, my team decided to evaluate the information architecture of the livery's FAQ and parking page.<br><br>
		The major findings we discovered from the usability tests were:</p>
		<br>
			<ul>
				<li class="uxp-list">Users are looking for key information.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">Users want material with a high skim factor.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">The livery's webpages overload users with information.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">The livery's webpage terms are confusing, even for experienced users.</li>
			</ul>
		<br>
		<p class="projectlist">We provided the following recommendations to the City of Ann Arbor to address the issues we uncovered:</p>
		<br>
			<ul>
				<li class="uxp-list">Avoid jargon in website headers and content.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">Improve visibility of key information.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">Establish clear structure on webpage and highlight the FAQ section.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">Utilize clear visuals.</li>
				<!--<br>-->
				<li class="uxp-list">Clarify livery rules on webpage.</li>
			</ul>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4 class="projectitle">Key methodologies:</h4>
		<p class="projectlist">Semi-structured interviews, usability testing</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h4 class="projectitle">Results:</h4>
		<p class="projectlist">Presented findings and recommendations to client's parks and recreation supervisor, IT department head, and communications specialist.</p>
